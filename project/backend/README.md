```

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (or the version specified in your project)
- Recommended: A virtual environment to manage dependencies

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fmcsa_api.git
   cd fmcsa_api
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the backend server, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

This command starts your application. Ensure any required environment variables or configurations are set prior to launching.

## API Endpoints

### Query Endpoint

- **Endpoint:** `/api/carrier`  
- **Method:** `POST`  
- **Description:** Use this endpoint to query FMCSA data.  
- **Parameters:**  
  - You can refer to `app/routes/query.py`
   for details regarding query parameters and expected responses.

*(Add more endpoints here as your project expands.)*

## Scraper Module

The `scraper.py` module is responsible for collecting data from FMCSA sources. It includes functions for:

- Fetching data from external sources
- Parsing and validating the data
- Storing the processed data for later retrieval via API endpoints

Review the comments within `scraper.py` for more detailed information on its functionality.

## Testing

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure that you have [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) installed as specified in `requirements.txt`.
